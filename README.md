# ✨ Prompt Improver Using Gemini

A smart **Chrome Extension + Flask backend** system that automatically **enhances user-written prompts** by leveraging a **curated prompt dataset, similarity-based matching, and the Gemini API**.

The system analyzes the user’s input, finds **semantically similar prompts from a dataset**, and uses them as context to generate a **clearer, more effective, and well-structured prompt**.

## 🚀 Key Highlights
- ✍️ Automatic prompt enhancement  
- 📚 Dataset-driven sentence framing  
- 🔎 Similarity-based prompt retrieval  
- 🤖 Gemini API–powered generation  
- 🌐 Chrome Extension for seamless usage  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Chrome Extension (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)  
- Python (Flask)  
- Gemini API  
- ML-based prompt similarity (TF-IDF / embeddings)  

---

## 🔍 How It Works
1. User enters a raw prompt in the extension  
2. Prompt is sent to the Flask backend  
3. Backend finds similar prompts from the dataset  
4. Context is framed using retrieved examples  
5. Gemini API generates an improved prompt  
6. Enhanced prompt is returned and inserted

## 📡 System Flow
**User → Extension → Backend (Dataset + ML + Gemini) → Extension → User**
